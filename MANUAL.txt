SERIOUSLY, WHY ANOTHER 65c02 ASSEMBLER?

(Very good ones out there, for instance Ophis 2.0)
(Want to write one in Forth for the practice and because I'm going to build a Forth machine)
(I really, really don't like the syntax)
(Older assemblers focused on small size)


BUT WHY FORTH?


SYNTAX

Because we're dealing with Forth here, the format is slightly different. We start with the operand, followed by a special version of the opcode that includes the mode. For instance: 

    lda #$ea        becomes           ea lda.#
    lda $1000       becomes         1000 lda 

The new opcodes are orientated along the space between them. We call this adding a "postfix" to the opcode. The list of postfixes is:

    implied                   dex                    dex
    accumulator               asl                    asl.a 

    relative                  bne $01             01 bne (ALPHA)

    immediate                 lda #$00            00 lda.#
    absolute                  lda $1000         1000 lda
    absolute x indexed        lda $1000,x       1000 lda.x
    absolute y indexed        lda $1000,y       1000 lda.y
    absolute indirect         jmp ($1000)       1000 jmp.i
    indexed indirect          jmp ($1000,x)     1000 jmp.xi   (65c02)
    zero page                 lda $10             10 lda.z
    zero page x indexed       lda $00,x           00 lda.zx
    zero page y indexed       lda $00,y           00 lda.zy
    zero page indirect        lda ($10)           10 lda.zi   (65c02)
    zp indirect x indexed     lda ($10,x)         10 lda.zxi  [sic]
    zp indirect y indexed     lda ($10),y         10 lda.ziy  [sic]

Note we don't have to use "$", "%" or "#" for formats because we can use HEX, BINARY, and DECIMAL from normal Forth. As an example, we'll convert this small loop

                lda #$00
                tax
        hierher
                sta $1000,x
                dex
                bne hierher

to Übersquirrel syntax:

             00 lda.#
                tax
   .l hierher
           1000 sta.x
                dex
        hierher bne   


There are a few special cases. The assembler instruction "and" conflicts with the Forth AND, so it is coded and. (note dot at the end).
